Describe the process of creating a new issue or bug report in the issue tracking system.


Process:

1.identify the problem or bug you encountered in the software. Restate the problem and note the steps you took to get to that point.
2.Gather any relevant information you can find about the problem, such as software version, operating system, hardware configuration, and error messages or screenshots.
3.The title of a bug report should be short and summarize the problem in a few words.
4.Write a detailed description of the problem, explaining what's happening, how it's happening, and why it's a problem. Please provide the exact steps to reproduce the problem and any error messages or logs that may help identify the root cause.
5.Assign a severity level to a problem based on how it affects the software and users. Use a severity scale from low to critical, with critical indicating a major impact on the software.
6.Assign a priority level to an issue based on its urgency, importance, and impact on the software and users. Use a scale from low to critical priority, which indicates that the problem needs to be addressed immediately.
7.If you have relevant files (such as screenshots, error messages, or logs), attach them to the bug report. These files help developers understand the problem and its root cause.
8.Once you've filed a bug report, submit it to the appropriate team or person responsible for resolving the issue.
